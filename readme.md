# IMnotDB - React Movies ðŸŽ¬

![hero](https://github.com/anav5704/Movie-React/blob/main/docs/imnotdb.png)

This is a simple movie website where users can search up movies, tv shows and anime. This was my first ever React JS project and uses the open movie database  (OMDB) api to fetch the results. I was blow away when I had learnt about conditional rendering user JavaScript ternary opeerators.

## Technologies Used

- React JS
- OMDB api

## Getting Started

First fork and clone the repo. First run ```npm install``` to download all the dependencies. Once that is done, run npm start to view it on localhost. No need to worry about the api key, mine is still in there.
