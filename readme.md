# IMnotDB - React Movies ðŸŽ¬

![hero](https://github.com/anav5704/Movie-React/blob/main/docs/imnotdb.png)

This is a simple movie website where users can search for movies, TV shows, and anime. This was my first ever React JS project and used the open movie database  (OMDB) API to fetch the results. I was blown away when I learned about conditional rendering using JavaScript ternary operators.

## Technologies Used

- React JS
- OMDB API

## Getting Started

First fork and clone the repo. First run ```npm install``` to download all the dependencies. Now make a ```.env``` file in the root of the project and add your API key from OMDB:

```
VITE_API_KEY
```

Once that is done, run npm start to view it on localhost.
